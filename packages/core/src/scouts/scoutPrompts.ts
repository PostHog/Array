export const SCOUT_FLEET_OVERVIEW_PROMPT = `How is my scout fleet performing?

Use the exploring-signals-scouts skill from the PostHog MCP to survey the signals scout fleet on this project and give me a high-level overview:

- The fleet: which scouts exist, enabled vs disabled, and their cadences
- Recent run health: success rate, failures and timeouts, anything stuck
- Output: which scouts emitted signals recently, emit rate, signal-to-noise
- Memory: notable scratchpad entries the fleet has learned
- Recommendations: anything misconfigured, noisy, or worth tuning

Lead with a short overall verdict, then per-scout notes only where something is notable. If the skill is unavailable, fall back to the signals-scout MCP tools directly (config list, runs list, scratchpad search).`;

export const SCOUT_RECENT_SIGNALS_PROMPT = `What signals have my scouts emitted recently?

Use the exploring-signals-scouts skill from the PostHog MCP to pull the most recent scout runs that emitted findings and walk me through the signals:

- What each signal says, in plain language
- Which scout emitted it, when, and its severity/confidence where available
- Whether it looks genuinely actionable or like noise

Group by scout, newest first. Close with a short note on overall signal quality and any scouts that look noisy or suspiciously silent. If the skill is unavailable, fall back to the signals-scout MCP tools directly (runs list with emitted filter, run emissions).`;

/** Per-scout variant of the templated questions, scoped to one skill. */
export function buildScoutCheckinPrompt(
  skillName: string,
  displayName: string,
): string {
  return `How is my ${displayName} scout performing?

Use the exploring-signals-scouts skill from the PostHog MCP to dig into the \`${skillName}\` scout on this project:

- Its config: enabled, cadence, dry-run posture
- Recent run history: successes, failures, timeouts, durations
- Signals it emitted recently and whether they look genuinely actionable
- Scratchpad memory the fleet holds that relates to this scout
- Whether its scope, thresholds, and schedule look right – suggest tuning if not

Lead with a short verdict. If the skill is unavailable, fall back to the signals-scout MCP tools directly (config list, runs list, run emissions, scratchpad search).`;
