# Plan Mode Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a new "Plan Mode" feature in Array that provides an interactive, research-driven planning flow before code execution. This complements the existing "Workflow Mode" by allowing users to conduct deep research, answer clarifying questions, and generate/edit implementation plans.

## What Was Built

### 1. Type System & State Management

**Files Modified:**
- `src/shared/types.ts` - Added plan mode types
- `src/renderer/stores/taskExecutionStore.ts` - Extended state management
- `src/renderer/types/electron.d.ts` - Added IPC type definitions

**Key Types:**
```typescript
type ExecutionMode = "plan" | "workflow";
type PlanModePhase = "idle" | "research" | "questions" | "planning" | "review";
interface ClarifyingQuestion { id, question, options, requiresInput }
interface QuestionAnswer { questionId, selectedOption, customInput? }
```

### 2. Backend Implementation

**Files Created:**
- `src/main/prompts/research-questions.ts` - Research phase prompt
- `src/main/prompts/generate-plan.ts` - Planning phase prompt

**Files Modified:**
- `src/main/services/fs.ts` - File operations for plan.md
- `src/main/services/agent.ts` - Plan mode agent execution
- `src/main/preload.ts` - IPC bridge methods

**New IPC Handlers:**
- `agent-start-plan-mode` - Runs research & question generation
- `agent-generate-plan` - Generates plan from answers
- `read-plan-file` - Reads plan.md from .posthog folder
- `write-plan-file` - Writes plan.md to .posthog folder
- `ensure-posthog-folder` - Creates .posthog/{task_id} directory

### 3. Frontend Components

**Files Created:**
- `src/renderer/components/interactive-terminal/InteractiveQuestion.tsx`
- `src/renderer/components/interactive-terminal/QuestionList.tsx`
- `src/renderer/components/interactive-terminal/InteractiveTerminal.tsx`
- `src/renderer/components/PlanEditor.tsx`
- `src/renderer/components/PlanView.tsx`

**Files Modified:**
- `src/renderer/components/TaskDetail.tsx` - Main integration point

**Component Features:**
- **InteractiveQuestion**: Single question with keyboard navigation
- **QuestionList**: Manages multiple questions and tracks answers
- **InteractiveTerminal**: Wrapper for question interface
- **PlanEditor**: TipTap-based markdown editor for plan.md
- **PlanView**: Orchestrates different views (terminal, questions, editor)

### 4. User Interface Changes

**TaskDetail Enhancements:**
- Segmented control to toggle between Plan/Workflow modes
- `Shift+Tab` keyboard shortcut for mode switching
- Dynamic button text based on execution mode
- Conditional rendering of right pane based on mode and phase

**Visual Indicators:**
- Active question highlighted with blue background
- Completed questions show checkmark and fade
- Current selection indicator (→ arrow)
- Keyboard shortcut hints displayed

### 5. Plan Mode Flow

```
User Action                 → System State         → UI Display
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Click "Start Research"      → phase: "research"    → Terminal logs
  ↓
Agent researches codebase
  ↓
Questions generated         → phase: "questions"   → Interactive Q&A
  ↓
User answers questions      → answers tracked
  ↓
Click "Generate Plan"       → phase: "planning"    → Terminal logs
  ↓
Agent generates plan
  ↓
Plan.md written             → phase: "review"      → Plan editor
  ↓
User edits & saves plan     → content updated
  ↓
Switch to Workflow mode     → executionMode: "workflow"
  ↓
Run agent                   → Agent uses plan.md as context
```

## Key Features

### 1. Research Phase
- Agent explores codebase using read-only tools
- Identifies relevant patterns and approaches
- Generates 3-5 clarifying questions with specific options
- Questions reference actual code patterns found

### 2. Interactive Q&A
- Keyboard-driven interface (↑↓ or j/k, Enter to select)
- Visual feedback with highlighting
- Support for custom text input
- Mouse click support as alternative
- Cannot proceed until all questions answered

### 3. Plan Generation
- Agent uses question answers as context
- Generates detailed markdown plan
- Saves to `.posthog/{task_id}/plan.md`
- Automatic phase transition to review

### 4. Plan Editor
- TipTap rich text editor with markdown support
- File mentions with @ syntax
- Save functionality with timestamp
- Close button to return to terminal
- Auto-loads existing plans

### 5. Workflow Integration
- Plan.md available as context in workflow mode
- Seamless transition between modes
- Plan persists across sessions

## Technical Decisions

### Why Not Workflow-Based?
- Plan mode uses `Agent.run()` instead of `Agent.runWorkflow()`
- Allows custom prompts without modifying workflow system
- More flexible for research and question generation

### Question Extraction
- Agent outputs JSON in markdown code block
- Frontend parses JSON from terminal logs
- Automatic phase transition when questions found
- Fallback to research phase if parsing fails

### State Management
- Per-task execution state in Zustand store
- Questions and answers tracked in memory
- Plan content cached after generation
- Execution mode not persisted (always starts in workflow)

### File System
- Plans stored in `.posthog/{task_id}/` folder
- Follows PostHog agent conventions
- Folder created automatically on first save
- Markdown format for easy version control
