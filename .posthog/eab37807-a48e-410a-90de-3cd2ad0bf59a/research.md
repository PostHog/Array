I'll explore the codebase to understand how tabs are implemented and generate clarifying questions for adding a plus button tab.
Great! Let me examine the TabBar component which is likely where I need to add the plus button.
Perfect! Now let me check the tab store to understand how tabs are created:
Now let me check for icon usage in the codebase to see what plus icon is available:
Perfect! Now let me check the shared types to understand tab types better:
Now let me check the CommandMenu to see how new tabs can be created via the command menu:
Now let me search for how buttons are styled in the application to match the visual style:
Let me check the StatusBar to see if there are any similar button implementations:
Excellent! Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the codebase. Let me create the research questions based on my findings.

Based on my analysis of the codebase, I can now create clarifying questions for implementing the plus button tab feature. Here's what I've learned:

1. **TabBar Component** (`/Users/jonathan/dev/Array/src/renderer/components/TabBar.tsx`): Contains the tab rendering logic with drag-and-drop support, keyboard shortcuts, and close buttons
2. **Tab Store** (`/Users/jonathan/dev/Array/src/renderer/stores/tabStore.ts`): Manages tab state with `createTab` function
3. **Tab Types**: Defined in `/Users/jonathan/dev/Array/src/shared/types.ts` - currently supports "task-list", "task-detail", "backlog", "settings", "recordings"
4. **Icon Usage**: The app uses `@radix-ui/react-icons` (e.g., `PlusIcon` is available and used in TaskList)
5. **Button Styling**: Uses `IconButton` from `@radix-ui/themes` with variants like "ghost" and size options

Now let me create the research questions:
I've completed my research of the codebase and identified the key implementation questions. Here's what I found:

## Codebase Analysis Summary

**Key Files:**
- `TabBar.tsx` - Main tab rendering component with drag-and-drop, keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+1-9, Cmd+W, etc.)
- `tabStore.ts` - Zustand store managing tab state with `createTab()` function
- `types.ts` - Defines TabState with types: "task-list", "task-detail", "backlog", "settings", "recordings"
- The app uses `@radix-ui/react-icons` (PlusIcon available) and `@radix-ui/themes` components

**Current Tab Structure:**
- Tabs are in a scrollable container with a 40px height
- Each tab has similar styling with borders, hover states, and active indicators
- Tabs support drag-and-drop reordering and context menus
- Close buttons appear on hover (except when only 1 tab exists)

## Clarifying Questions

I've identified 4 key questions that will guide the implementation:

1. **Functionality**: What should the plus button do when clicked? (Open task modal vs create new tab)
2. **Positioning**: Where should it be placed? (Inside scrollable area vs fixed position)
3. **Styling**: Should it match tab styling or use a button-like appearance?
4. **Interactions**: Any keyboard shortcuts needed?

Each question includes 2-3 concrete options based on existing patterns I found in the codebase, plus a "something else" option for flexibility.

Ready to present these questions for your input!
