# PostHog - Array

The PostHog desktop task manager

## The Goal

Free product engineers from distractions so they can focus on what they love: building great features. By using agents to transform all data collected across PostHog’s products into actionable “tasks,” then exposing them with that context through a single interface, we can automate all the chores and save developers hours every day, giving them more time to ship.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- pnpm 9+

### Setup

```bash
# Install pnpm if you haven't already
npm install -g pnpm

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run in development mode
pnpm run dev

# Build for production
pnpm run build

# Other useful commands
pnpm run typecheck  # Type checking
pnpm run lint       # Linting
```

### Environment Variables

You can set these environment variables instead of entering credentials in the app:

- `POSTHOG_API_KEY` - Your PostHog personal API key
- `POSTHOG_API_HOST` - PostHog instance URL (defaults to https://app.posthog.com)

## Architecture

- **Electron** - Desktop app framework
- **React** - UI framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **Zustand** - State management - we should probably switch to kea
- **Vite** - Build tool
